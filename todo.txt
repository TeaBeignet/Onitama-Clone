to do:
✓break up move_check function into move_check(to check viability of moves) and move_check_plus(to check user input moves, and output reasons for failure)
✓create a take command
✓create listen function to accept user input
    ✓create help command (prints list of commands)
    ✓create print commands (✓deck(prints given deck), ✓board(prints current board config), ✓pos_moves(prints all possible move inputs))
    ✓create move command (takes (where, card, there) as parameters, and uses movers_and_shakers)
    ✓create rules command (prints instructions)

non-fatal errors:
✓check_move does not consider if 'there' is equal to player.king as a failure
✓pos_moves always uses default direction
✓pos_moves does not print any king moves
✓/move command does not call movers_and_shakers properly
✓/move command occasionally removes played card, but does not move piece/print board

    leads:
    replicable error: even in other contexts
    failure when moving d & e row pieces
    success when moving a, b, & c row pieces
    pieces moved into d & e rows remain movable
